# Scenario - Golf Counter

As an anonymous application user
I want to count my golf shots
So that I can not have to use a barbaric pencil and paper

## Examples - Initial State

Given the user acesses the golf counter feature
Then the current count should 0
And the increment button should enabled
and the decrement button should be disabled
